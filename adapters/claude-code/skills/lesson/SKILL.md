# lesson

Capture a correction as a gated, graduating lesson — staged for approval, then promoted to a hook/lint rule or a scoped note.

**This is a thin adapter.** The full, tool-agnostic instructions live in the pack core.
Read and follow the core skill body, then execute its steps against this project:

> **Core body:** `../_core/meta/lesson.md`

Resolve every `{{config.*}}` reference in the core body against the EFFECTIVE config —
the global `~/.claude/workflow.config.yaml` (machine defaults) merged with this project's
`workflow.config.yaml` (project overrides win). Run `node <_core>/setup/config.mjs resolve`
to get it, or read the project file directly when there is no global layer. If a referenced
optional config value is absent, skip that step and record it in the skill's Deferred
ledger. When the host tool lacks parallel subagents or a named-agent registry, follow the
core body's sequential fallback.
