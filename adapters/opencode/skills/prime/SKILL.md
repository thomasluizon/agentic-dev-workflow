Load project context (all repos + optional issue) so downstream skills have warm context.

**This is a thin adapter.** The full, tool-agnostic instructions live in the pack core.
Read and follow the core skill body, then execute its steps against this project:

> **Core body:** `../_core/pipeline/prime.md`

Resolve every `{{config.*}}` reference in the core body against this project's
`workflow.config.yaml` (at the project root). If a referenced optional config value is
absent, skip that step and record it in the skill's Deferred ledger. When the host tool
lacks parallel subagents or a named-agent registry, follow the core body's sequential
fallback.
